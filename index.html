      <h1>Run</h1>

    </div>

    <div id="lap1">
      <h2>Lap One</h2>
      <p>You run. You run because there&rsquo;s nothing else left to do. The fence has been inspected, the head count completed, the medicines inventoried, the locks all checked, the keys accounted for, your pistol primed and holstered. The garden won&rsquo;t need attention until the afternoon. Although you&rsquo;ve already walked it, the dirt track around the fence is the clearest path. The Perimeter around the compound is about a mile in length. You count off the tasks you will need to address later, like words to a familiar song stuck in your head, sung to the rhythm of the pounding of your feet. Your routine would have felt oppressive only a few months ago, but now it gives you comfort, a sense of control and purpose in an otherwise mad world.</p>
      <p>In first grade you were the last kid to finish the one mile run-walk, two minutes behind Elizabeth Greeves. All the kids made fun of her for being last. You tried to correct them, but they didn&rsquo;t listen. You had asthma and always felt like you were coughing up blood after any cardiovascular activity. You were last, and nobody but you cared. That was almost twenty years ago.</p>
      <p>Now you are running. Your feet hit the packed dirt in a steady succession of impact, lift, impact, lift, your soles cushioned only by a pair of Nikes that are beginning to wear thin.  Now it is dawn, the swift transition between the world of the Dead and the world of the Living. You are running because it is dawn, and running makes you breathe in a steady, invigorating, wholesome way. You run because you still breathe.</p>
      <p>You remember the first time you knew you could run, that the barrier in your mind was discovered and eradicated. You were training Cody Dickens to catch shoplifters out in the grass behind the store. Your job was to pretend to be exiting the store with stolen goods and then to turn and run suddenly. It was the first time you&rsquo;d gotten to act since you were in A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream in middle school. You used to love acting - the thrill of pretending to be somebody you&rsquo;re not, leaving your own life for awhile. You should&rsquo;ve been an actor. Not that it would&rsquo;ve mattered anyway.<p>
      <p>But now you must remind yourself that you were remembering running, not lamenting the decisions of a previous life. You were training Cody, your job was to turn and run, Cody was reaching out to grab you by the arm. You had mentally immersed yourself in your role &ndash; shoplifter, motivation: don&rsquo;t get caught. His hand was almost around your arm when you instinctively turned on your heels and bolted in the opposite direction. He ran after you, then gave up and called your name. You stopped and jogged back, enjoying the feel of the fresh air pouring into your lungs. He asked if you ran track in high school. You laughed. He cursed and said he hoped no real shoplifters could run like that. You laughed again, because you know you can&rsquo;t run, whatever Cody Dickens says. But something had shifted. It was all around you: the message, the secret.</p>
      <p>You hadn&rsquo;t realized what you were supposed to be learning. It was articulated for you in a yoga class one night by April Lovett. You were surrounded by middle-aged women who called you &quot;cute&quot; and always marveled at your flexibility. You were in a bridge position and April was standing over you, telling you to extend your arms and lift your shoulders to go into a wheel. It hadn&rsquo;t seemed so terrifying a proposition until you were there, inverted, hips lifted, watched by 6 women your mother&rsquo;s age. You said, &quot;I can&rsquo;t.&quot; You were embarrassed; they all had expected you to perform, and you were too weak. But she said, &quot;It&rsquo;s just mind over matter. I&rsquo;m right here. Lift.&quot; And you used your mind, as if for the first time, to move your body. To defy your body. And then you had the words for it, &quot;Mind over matter.&quot;</p>
      <p>You pass the sycamore tree, the marker where you began your run. On a busier day you might stop here and go back inside to complete the rounds, but today &ndash; today there are still a few minutes left to the dawn. Today you will run.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap2">
      <h2>Lap Two</h2>
      <p>The first corner, well, it&rsquo;s not a true corner, but the first big curve in the fence, is your cue to begin the list. Impact, lift. Impact, lift. Supervise breakfast clean up with the Captain. Take the Boys out into the yard for exercise. Quick meeting with Peer Leaders to see how their crews are doing while the rest of the boys run laps. Give today&rsquo;s crew assignments to Peer Leaders. Send Crew 2 in to begin preparing lunch. Sessions with Marquez, Klein, Cherry, and Freeman. (Avoid talking about the Dead, only the long-dead past: the rape, the assault, the arson, the dog that was dissected alive and left on the neighbor&rsquo;s porch. And the undead past: drug-addicted parents, abusive foster parents, the molestation, the sight of his mother&rsquo;s body as his step-father raped it one last time. Close the old wounds slowly. Treat the present like another life. Keep them regimented.)</p>
      <p>&quot;Mind over matter.&quot; You wonder if time counts as matter. If time matters. If there is such a thing as present and past, or if everything is in a state of constant convergence in our mind. If we ever wake up from the nightmares of the past. If the nightmares of the past are really worse than the current nightmare you can&rsquo;t wake up from. Mind over time. Mind over nightmare.</p>
      <p>You pass the garage where you first fired your pistol. Mind over matter. Dead, Living, walking, limping, running, shuffling. The Captain had told you it was time for you to draw your first blood. You protested, saying you&rsquo;d been trained in phlebotomy when you first got the job here, but he just stared at you until you said, &quot;Ok, Captain.&quot; You know you used to know his Christian name, but you can&rsquo;t remember what it is. Or was. Now he&rsquo;s the Captain.</p>
      <p>So the Captain showed you how to raise the pistol, how to aim, how to let your body respond to the kickback. How to draw blood. How to drop the Dead. How not to care. You&rsquo;ve never admired his resolve, his brusque disposition, his indifference to moral reasoning. But you see how it helps him survive. You can&rsquo;t afford to be mopey, overly-contemplative, or philosophical when the Dead are walking the Earth. You view his demeanor more as a principle to be studied, a Confucian axiom you must remember when you are lost in this world.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap3">
      <h2>Lap Three</h2>
      <p>The Sycamore again. Impact. Lift. Impact. Lift. Dirt compacting beneath your feet. The fence streaming past you in a never-ending whirl of wire links. Your list: Supervise lunch. Eat. Supervise clean up. Harvest ready crops from garden. Plan meals for next week. Room inspections. Meeting with the Captain and Peer Leaders to finalize the plan for Operation Libros &ndash; Be sure to make a list of necessary titles for the library and highlight aisles on the bookstore map to find the highest concentrations of quality literature. Sessions with Jackson, Walters, Allen, and Liacona. (Discuss strategies for managing anger, controlling sexual aggression, positive relationships with authority, coping with withdrawal and developing non-destructive responses to adversity: exercise, positive self-talk, routines.)</p>
      <p>You are starting to feel the heat of the morning pounding on your back. Sweat begins to trickle down the side of your face. The garage. You were reliving your first shot.</p>
      <p>You had been carrying the pistol for weeks, as a safety precaution. You knew the procedures for how to use it and had fired it on a range. Even though you were a decent shot and could operate, clean, and repair the weapon, you still didn&rsquo;t know how you were to use it. You counted on the scarcity of ammo to keep you from ever finding out how it was truly meant to be used. But the Captain was impossible to resist. When he made a command, you followed it. Everybody did. Even the Boys who had kicked cops and pissed on guards and gave the finger to the judge when they were sentenced, even they all listened to the Captain, even before the Dead were walking. Rank doesn&rsquo;t matter, authority and respect do. The Captain possesses these latter qualities. That&rsquo;s how a custodian managed to keep 80 delinquent adolescent males in line before the Dead rose and after. Before the Dead could walk, the time of the Risen Dead. You wonder if time will be marked this way, and it amuses you that BC and AD also mark time in relation to a risen corpse.</p>
      <p>The shot. You don&rsquo;t like to remember it, but it needs to be remembered or you may not be able to draw on that lesson when you will need it most. Sometimes things must die. Sometimes, you must be the killer. You raised the pistol and sighted the half-mangled corpse clinging to the fence. You adjusted to aim for the skull. It moaned the rattling groan of the hungry Dead as it dragged its bloated fingers across the chain-link. You tried to look into its eyes for some reason not to do it. They were cloudy and inflamed. It lurched at you and shook the fence. And you did it. You pulled the trigger and unleashed the power of man&rsquo;s ingenuity, a power still only possessed by the Living. The bullet tore through the already decaying flesh and made a sickening bang and crack that were almost simultaneous. The blood spray seemed surreal &ndash; droplets flying in every direction. The moment was so slow from its intensity that you feel as though you have time to even count the droplets as they splatter. But this is a memory. And there wasn&rsquo;t enough time to count, even though the moment seemed to last forever. Even though it still doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s over.</p>
      <p>But you are running now. You are safe.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap4">
      <h2>Lap Four</h2>
      <p>You decide to count other things. (Forget the breakfast clean up; you are running today.) Impact. Lift. Impact. Lift. Dirt passing beneath your feet, fence passing by your side &ndash; these things are too small and fleeting to count. Blessings, victories, laps &ndash; these you can count.</p>
      <p>You start with blessings: You are alive. The sun is shining. There have been no major incidents in over a month. Everyone inside the Perimeter is still alive. Some of the Boys even seem to be making progress. The garden has thus far been fruitful. The hens are still laying eggs. The expedition to the hardware store and the instillation of solar panels won you the admiration of the Captain and the Boys, and you now command almost as much respect as the Captain himself. You can run now.</p>
      <p>The blessings have somehow blended with the victories. What&rsquo;s the difference anyway?</p>
      <p>You decide to count laps.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap5">
      <h2>Lap Five</h2>
      <p>Sycamore. Impact. Lift. Impact. Lift. Steps are too grueling and laps are too spread out to count. You count the Living. Seventy-six Boys. One Captain. One Therapist. Seventy-eight survivors. You name them all until you get to the Captain.</p>
      <p>Oh well. What&rsquo;s in a name anyway?</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap6">
      <h2>Lap Six</h2>
      <p>Elizabeth Greeves and Cody Dickens and April Lovett &ndash; you remember their names, although they were only players in your back-story. You count them among the Dead, and it pains you to think that even in an ordinary life, in your old life, you would have counted them among the casualties of the past &ndash; memories and not living, breathing human beings co-existing in the invisible world outside of your own life.</p>
      <p>There is a world outside of you. People you used to know still exist and are doing something, thinking something, right now, somewhere you can only guess. Or they were. You consider the fact that there is still a world outside of the fence that guides your current path. Perhaps your old acquaintances are still out there somewhere, surviving and existing just like you.  It still baffles you. And then a much more confounding and disturbing fact enters your mind &ndash; the Dead exist. They exist right now. They are out there. Walking. Feeding. And &ndash; this conjecture horrifies you most &ndash; perhaps Thinking.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap7">
      <h2>Lap Seven</h2>
      <p>Sycamore. Impact. Lift. Impact. Lift.</p>
      <p>Running isn&rsquo;t so hard when you manage to take your mind off it. When you forget about what you&rsquo;re doing, you feel as though you could run forever.</p>
      <p>In your old life you could&rsquo;ve been a marathon runner. Not like an Olympic or competitive marathon runner, but maybe you could&rsquo;ve run in some of those marathon races to raise money for charities to fight diseases like cancer. You almost laugh at the thought of fighting cancer. Or you running a marathon. The old you never would have believed yourself capable of it. And that&rsquo;s what matters, whether you think you can. Mind over matter. Like the little engine of children&rsquo;s motivational literature: I think I can. I think I can. I can. I can. I am.</p>
      <p>Running clears the mind so you can think. Thinking clears the mind so you can run.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="lap8">
      <h2>Lap Eight</h2>
      <p>Sycamore. Impact, lift, impact, lift. You are in a rhythm now. You feel unstoppable, as though you are not running, but simply submitting to the kinetic energy flowing through your legs. Your mind is so clear it feels as though it is no longer anchored to your body. Truth is the atmosphere effortlessly flowing into your lungs. You are lucid, absorbing everything: past and present and all the tomorrows. It is all so clear now: your path, the function of a routine, the beauty of a perfect circle.</p>
      <p>You&rsquo;ve got it all figured out now. Or at least, you&rsquo;re starting to. Maybe this is runner&rsquo;s high. In any case, the whole world seems to have boiled down to a few simple truths:</p>
      <p>If you can run and fire a gun and scavenge, then you might survive. If you can mend a fence, and grow a garden, and raise chickens, you might be safe. If you can protect the weak, organize the masses, and preserve their last scraps of humanity, you might feel alive again.</p>
      <p>But running for the sake of running creates the illusion of being alive.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, you will run further, stretch your mind out farther.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow you will finally wrap your mind around it all. You will finally figure out how to save the world.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, you and the Captain and the Boys will defeat the plague of the Dead and discover that there is more life than what you&rsquo;ve managed to preserve inside the Perimeter. You will gather the survivors, reunite the race, and save humanity. </p>
      <p>Tomorrow you will defeat Death itself. Mind over matter.</p>
      <p>But right now, you will run.</p>
